Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis

Introduction to Stress Level Data Visualization
In the realm of mental health research and analysis, understanding stress levels and their underlying factors is crucial for developing effective interventions and support mechanisms. The "Stress Level Data Visualization" lab provides an immersive exploration into a dataset, named "StressLevelDataset.csv," which contains a rich array of variables that may influence or indicate stress levels in individuals. Through a series of data visualization activities, this lab aims to equip participants with the skills to analyze and interpret stress-related data, shedding light on potential correlations and patterns.

Dataset Description
The core of this lab lies in the exploration of the "StressLevelDataset.csv," a meticulously curated dataset designed to capture various aspects of individuals' mental well-being. The dataset includes parameters such as anxiety levels, self-esteem, mental health history, sleep quality, and a quantified measure of stress level. Each entry in the dataset represents a unique individual, providing a comprehensive overview of diverse factors that contribute to the complex landscape of stress.

Follow these steps to construct your scatter plot:

Utilize the provided code to plot a scatter plot with 'anxiety level' on the x-axis and 'depression' on the y-axis.

Ensure that each axis is appropriately labeled â€“ 'Anxiety Level' for the x-axis and 'Depression' for the y-axis.

The title of the plot should be 'Anxiety Level vs. Depression', as indicated in the code.

Observe how the points are distributed in the plot. Look for any patterns or trends that indicate a relationship between anxiety level and depression.

Maintain the default settings for figure size, color, and other plot characteristics as specified in the code.

After generating the plot, analyze and interpret the potential correlation between the two variables.


Follow these steps to create your bar chart:

Use the provided code to calculate the average stress level for two groups: those with a mental health history and those without.

Create a bar chart where each bar represents one of these two groups.

Ensure the x-axis is labeled as 'Mental Health History' with two categories: 'No History' and 'History'.

The y-axis should represent the 'Average Stress Level'.

The title of the chart should be 'Average Stress Level by Mental Health History', as specified in the code.

Observe the differences in average stress levels between the two groups.

Keep the default settings for the figure size, color, and other plot characteristics unchanged as provided in the code.

After generating the chart, analyze the results to understand how mental health history might correlate with stress levels.


Follow these steps to construct your pie chart:

Use the provided code to determine the frequency of each sleep quality rating in the dataset.

Create a pie chart where each slice represents a different sleep quality rating. The size of each slice should correspond to the frequency of that rating.

Ensure that each slice is labeled with its respective sleep quality rating.

Include the percentage of each slice within the pie chart using the autopct parameter.

The title of the chart should be 'Sleep Quality Distribution', as specified in the code.

Observe the proportions of each sleep quality rating and how they contribute to the overall distribution.

Maintain the default settings for the figure size and other plot characteristics as provided in the code.

After generating the pie chart, analyze the data to understand the sleep quality trends among the participants.
