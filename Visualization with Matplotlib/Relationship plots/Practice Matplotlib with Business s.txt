Practice Matplotlib with Business sales analysis

Business sales analysis
This project will put in practice relationship plots using business sales data.

Our dataset is an intriguing collection of sales records from various divisions of a business. It includes vital information such as:

division: Different segments of the business, such as Computer Hardware, Office Supplies, and Printers.
level of education: The educational qualifications of employees, ranging from associate's degrees to higher levels.
training level: The extent of professional training received by employees.
work experience: The number of years employees have spent in their professional careers.
salary: The compensation awarded to employees.
sales: The sales figures achieved by each division.

What is the objective?
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand how different factors, such as educational background, training level, and work experience, influence sales performance across different business divisions.

The key requirement is to keep the default figure size, color, label, and title settings unmodified.
