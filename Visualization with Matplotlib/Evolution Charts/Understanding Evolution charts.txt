Understanding Evolution charts

Evolution plots
Evolution plots, also known as time series plots, are a type of data visualization used to display how a variable changes over time. These plots are commonly used in various fields, including economics, finance, climate science, and social sciences, to analyze trends, patterns, and fluctuations in time-dependent data. Here are some key characteristics and features of evolution plots:

Time as the X-Axis: Evolution plots have time or a sequential variable (e.g., months, years, time points) on the x-axis. This axis represents the progression of time or the order in which data points were collected.

Variable of Interest on the Y-Axis: The y-axis of an evolution plot represents the variable of interest that you want to visualize. This variable could be anything that changes over time, such as stock prices, temperature, sales, or population.

Data Points Connected by Lines: In most cases, data points representing measurements or observations at different time intervals are connected by lines. This line connection helps visualize the continuity and smoothness of the variable's evolution.

Markers or Symbols: Data points are often marked with symbols (e.g., circles, squares, triangles) or dots to make them more distinguishable and to emphasize specific data points, if necessary.

Title and Labels: Evolution plots typically include a title that describes the purpose or content of the plot. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled to indicate the meaning of the time and variable values.

Gridlines: Gridlines may be added to the plot to assist in reading and interpreting data values accurately.

Customization: Evolution plots can be customized to improve their clarity and visual appeal. You can change the color, line style, marker style, and other visual attributes to suit your preferences or to emphasize specific aspects of the data.

Analysis of Trends: Evolution plots are useful for identifying trends, cycles, seasonality, and irregular patterns in the data. Trendlines or moving averages can be added to highlight long-term trends.

Data Annotations: Annotations or labels may be added to the plot to provide additional information about specific data points or events in the time series.

Multiple Variables: Evolution plots can also display multiple variables on the same plot, allowing for comparisons and correlations between different aspects of the data.

In summary, evolution plots are a fundamental tool in time series analysis, providing a visual representation of how a variable changes over time. They are valuable for detecting patterns and making informed decisions in various domains where time-dependent data is collected and analyzed.

Time Series Visualization
Minimum Daily Temperatures Dataset
This dataset describes the minimum daily temperatures over 10 years (1981-1990) in the city Melbourne, Australia.

The units are in degrees Celsius and there are 3,650 observations. The source of the data is credited as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Rolling Average Plot
We will calculate a rolling average with a window size that captures a meaningful trend, and plot it to smooth out short-term fluctuations. A common choice for time series data like this is a 12-month rolling average, which helps in identifying yearly trends. ​

Monthly Averages
Finally, let's calculate and visualize the average temperature for each month across all years in the dataset. This will provide insights into the monthly seasonal effects. ​​
