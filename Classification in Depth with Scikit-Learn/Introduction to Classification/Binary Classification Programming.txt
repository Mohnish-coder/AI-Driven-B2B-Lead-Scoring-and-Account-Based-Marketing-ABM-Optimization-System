Binary Classification: Programming Exercise

Decision tree classification

For this implementation uses a decision tree classifier to predict the label of a fruit based on its color and weight. The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame and split into training and testing sets. The classifier is trained on the training data, and its accuracy is tested on the testing data.

Remember to encode the variable 'color' using, for example, 'get_dummies'. The models only understand numbers, not words or strings.

Split the dataset by using the function train_test_split(). You need to pass 3 parameters features, target, and test_set size. Split the dataset 30% test and 70% train and set using a random state=0. Store output of the split in X_train, Y_train, X_test and Y_test.

Then implement the decision tree using only random_state=0. Store the model in the variable cf, and finnaly estimate the accuracy of the model using the test dataset.


K-NN classification model

We continue working with previous dataset, but for this task train a KNN classifier to predict the label of a fruit based on its color and weight.

Split the dataset by using the function train_test_split(). You need to pass 3 parameters features, target, and test_set size. Split the dataset 30% test and 70% train and set using a random state=0. Store output of the split in X_train, Y_train, X_test and Y_test. Remember that KNN is sensitive to the scale of the features, so you should use StandardScaler to standardize the features and store the results in the variables X_train_scaler and X_test_scaler.

Then implement the KNN using the argument for default. Store the model in the variable knn, and finnaly estimate the accuracy of the model using the test dataset.


What are the advantages of the decision tree?
Decision trees are easy to visualize
Less Data Preparation

A student has a dataset with 500 data points that he want to use to train a KNN classifier. He trains 4 kNN classifiers (k={1,3,5,10}) using all the data points. Then you randomly select 300 data points from the 500, and classify them using each of the 4 classifiers.

Which classifier will come out as the best one?
k=1


KNN is an instance-based algorithm, which means that it does not need to train a model before making predictions.
The advantages of Decision Trees include their interpretability, versatility, and feature selection capabilities.
