Hyperparameter Tuning for a Random Forest Classifier

What is Hyperparameter Optimization?
In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameter for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.

What is balanced dataset?
A balanced dataset is important in machine learning because it ensures that the model is not biased towards any particular class.

What are the most used methods for hyperparameter optimization in ML?
Grid Search (GS) and Randomized Grid-Search (RGS) are the two most used methods for hyperparameter optimization in Machine Learning


Difference between Grid Search and Random Search?
Grid search is a process that searches exhaustively through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of the targeted algorithm.
Random search, on the other hand, selects a value for each hyperparameter independently using a probability distribution.

Random search is an alternative to grid search for hyperparameter tuning that has several advantages over grid search.

Random search involves randomly sampling hyperparameters from a continuous or discrete distribution, evaluating each set of hyperparameters, and selecting the set that yields the best performance on a validation set.
